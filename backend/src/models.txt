- TODO
1. For keeping the user logged-in even after refresh
Way 1 - Easy
Just store isLoggedIn variable in the localStorage and clear it after the user logs out.
- Steps
    1. Store both userId (if possible hash this) and logged-in information on localStorage, 
        and make the database call to get currentUser fields.
    2. Remove both fields after logout/expiry.

Way 2 - Recommended
1. Create a JWT token from backend (store it) for every logged-in session and send
it back to frontend.
(The cookies should be cleared after some time)
2. Frontend will store the token + isLoggedIn variable in localStorage and for each 
subsequent calls, the token will be passed along to the backend for correct
authorization.
3. To allow, subsequent log in from multiple device, allow multiple JWT token for a 
single userId, but we will need to delete the JWT token periodically (this is not figured yet)
4. If the token provided by frontend is not present in backend (not for signup/sigin calls), 
reject the calls and logout the user.
